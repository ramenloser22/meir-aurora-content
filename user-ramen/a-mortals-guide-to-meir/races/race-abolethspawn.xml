        <description>
            <p class="flavor">An aboleth was an ancient creature that ruled the primordial seas before the gods walked the planes. These creatures delighted in using their mental powers to enslave lesser beings. An aboleth spawn is a humanoid who carries within them a sliver of an aboleth's essence, giving them the aboleth's affinity for water and some of their mental ability. They might feel the desire to rule, as their primordial forbearers did, or the humanoid part of them might feel remorse for the weight of misdeeds from eons past.</p>
