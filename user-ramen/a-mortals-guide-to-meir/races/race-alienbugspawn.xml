      <p class="flavor">The alien bugs are strange otherworldly creatures that seek to enslave and dominate all other life. An alien bug spawn inherits the alien bug's emotionless nature and some of their insect-like abilities.</p>
      <h4>ALIEN BUG SPAWN TRAITS</h4>
      <p>Your alien bug spawn character has the following traits.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Alien bug spawn may or may not be evil, but they have a strong tendency toward lawful alignments.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You have vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mental Fortitude.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Child of Slavers.</em></strong> You can cast <em>charm person</em> once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Poisonous Touch.</em></strong> When you damage a creature with a melee weapon attack or melee spell attack, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra poison damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write two languages of your choice.</p>
